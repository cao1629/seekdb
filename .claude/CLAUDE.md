# SeekDB Project Instructions

## General Questions

When answering general questions (e.g., "what is partial specialization?", "what is mmap?", "what is a vtable?"), provide general answers as you would without project context. Do not tie the explanation specifically to SeekDB unless the user explicitly asks for project-specific examples.

## Code Exploration

Use LSP along with other tools (Grep, Glob, Read) when necessary to get better responses to questions about the codebase.
